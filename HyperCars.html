        <h3><strong>What Is A Super-Car?</strong></h3>
        <h6>The obvious answer is speed, both in terms of top speed and acceleration. In a hierarchy that begins with
            sports cars and ends with hypercars, supercars are the high-performance middle, featuring vehicles that are
            more than capable of tearing up the track and leaving common sports cars in the dust.
            <br>
            There are no broadly agreed demarcations on the term supercar, though. Some have cited a mid-engine
            requirement, but that would leave several high-performing front-engined models — such as the Ferrari
            F12berlinetta — out of the mix in a way that doesn’t make sense. Analyzing the feel behind the wheel and the
            use of unique technologies to enhance the driving experience could also play a role, as could other aspects
            of the vehicles such as power-to-weight ratio. Price and scarcity may also be relevant — but these things
            are often subjective.
            <br>
            Perhaps what matters to many is the nameplate of the vehicle itself. In that regard, brands like Ferrari are
            synonymous with both supercars and hypercars.

                <h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
                <p>A supercar – also called exotic car – is a loosely defined description of street-legal,
                    high-performance luxury sports car. Supercars commonly serve as the flagship model within a
                    vehicle manufacturer's lineup of sports cars. In the United States, muscle cars were often referred
                    to as "supercars" during the 1960s.A term supercar was coined to describe extremely expensive,
                    extremely beautiful and extremely fast cars. Heavily modified and potentially street - illegal
                    vehicles do not fall into the supercar category. Supercars are not muscle cars or tuned up sports
                    cars. And there is no such thing as a cut price supercar.</p>
            </div>

        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3><strong>Design</strong></h3>
                <p>First you have to put in your mind what "super car" means to you - is one that attracts attention,
                    one that can outperform any car on the Nurburgring, one that can run 250 mph at the Texas Mile, one
                    that can shave seconds off a tight road course, or maybe it's a blended performance-luxury GT.
                    Consider making a series of iterations to an existing platform rather than a completely new car.
                    Think of the car in 3 parts - the performance, the appearance, and interior. The popular supercar
                    makers know how to achieve a high degree of quality in all 3 areas, but brands like Pagani and
                    Bugatti are uncompromising in all 3 categories with a level of finish that can't be beat.
                    As a you would be a "new brand", you have to reconcile that it's a "powerless brand". Thus, you
                    would need to offer something superlative. Design around a platform that already exists. Most
                    importantly, the element of a high-performance supercar is its design.</p>
                <h3><strong>Pricing</strong></h3>
                <p>The supercar is not supposed to be a car that anyone can buy; to some, an affordable supercar defeats
                    the purpose of it being super in the first place. Supercars have a much higher standard of quality
                    than most any other consumer cars and are looked at by their producers and owners as meticulously
                    crafted works of art. Because of this ridiculous standard, supercars are consistently quite
                    expensive, far out of reach of almost everybody. A cheap supercar would imply lower quality, which
                    is the antithesis to the supercar, which is supposed to be hand-crafted and tuned to perfection. In
                    terms of supercars, nothing can be done for cheap and have nearly the same level of excellence as
                    something expensive.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3><strong>The core elements of a Super Cars</strong></h3>
                <p>A main difference drivers find between true supercars and imitators is the build quality. A supercar,
                    while designed for elegance, is mostly designed to be driven hard. These cars pride themselves on
                    insanely high speeds, so they need to be built to last and thrive. Most cars cannot handle extreme
                    speeds, never expecting constant speeds above 100-miles per hour, so they fall apart and become
                    unsafe.
                </p>
                <h3><strong>Limited releases</strong></h3>
                <p>A main difference drivers find between true supercars and imitators is the build quality. A supercar,
                    while designed for elegance, is mostly designed to be driven hard. These cars pride themselves on

                </p>
                <h3><strong>Appearance</strong></h3>
                <p>The first, and to some, most importantly, the element of a high-performance supercar is its design.
                    The world's fastest and most expensive cars also are the ones with the most iconic, robust, and
                    gorgeous designs. With the modern supercar, the design is not simply a form factor, but a key aspect
                    of what makes the cars special. Boutique brands who cater to this market see their cars as finely
                    crafted and tuned pieces of art, and the appearance of their cars lead this charge.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3><strong>Performance</strong></h3>
                <p>Mostly, we've talked about top speed for supercars, or the absolute fastest a car can go in a
                    controlled setting. However, this is only half of the speed equation. The modern supercar not only
                    needs to top out at an outrageously high speed, but it has to accelerate to the speed just as quick.
                    <br>
                    In racing, acceleration is paramount and the main route to victory, so supremely fast acceleration
                    has become the standard for the supercar style of vehicle. Acceleration is also how supercars are
                    able to move so quickly, creating energy to make quick turns and sudden jolts of power. To most,
                    this is where the true fun of the supercar comes, going from a standstill to blinding speeds in the
                    blink of an eye.

            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3><strong>Build quality</strong></h3>
                <p>The build quality is what differentiates a hypercar from a sports car and a supercar is the build
                    quality. Although a high performance hypercar is meant to be designed for elegance and high speeds,
                    they need to last and thrive seen as many cars cannot maintain high speeds, especially above 100
                    miles per hour to ensure they do not become unsafe. Referring back to the cost, they are expensive
                    and need to be built to a top quality standard to ensure the safety of the driver, passengers, and
                    road drivers.Stats of a supercar's engine are always absorbed by potential buyers, seeing how much
                    horsepower and torque it can create. However, looking just at these specs does not give the full
                    story. An element that must be considered in the supercar domain is the power-to-weight ratio.

                <h3><strong>Rarity</strong></h3>
                <p>The practice of limited releases of products has been shown to be extremely successful. We see it all
                    over in tech and fashion, yet the car industry uses this practice as well. Supercars, by their
                    definition, need to be limited release, because they need exclusivity and uniqueness to make them
                    worth their steep price. The supercar should draw all attention to it, and stand out on the road as
                    a unique vehicle. When one pictures themselves driving a supercar, the mental image of crowds of
                    people stopping to stare at your ride is the exact point. Supercars need to be rare because that is
                    their marketing: cars you envy, think about, but almost never see.</p>

        <div class="row featurette my-5">

            <div class="col-md-7 order-md-2">
                <p class="lead">The Regera has a reported total power output of 1,340 kW (1,797 hp; 1,822 PS) through a
                    hybrid powertrain. As in general, the Regera's internal combustion engine (ICE) generates its
                    greatest power only at high rpm; however, due to the fixed gear, this corresponds to very high
                    speeds. Power at low speeds is filled in by the electric motors, giving a maximum combined
                    mechanical power output of 1,119 kW (1,500 hp; 1,521 PS) and 2,000 N⋅m (1,475 lb⋅ft) of torque.The
                    Regera has a claimed, electronically limited top speed of 404 km/h (251 mph). Koenigsegg states it
                    is capable of accelerating to 100 km/h (62 mph) from a stand still in 2.8 seconds, 200 km/h (124
                    mph) in 6.6 seconds, 300 km/h (186 mph) in 10.9 seconds, and attaining a speed of 400 km/h (249 mph)
                    in 20 seconds. Koenigsegg also claims that the acceleration from 150–250 km/h (93–155 mph) requires
                    3.9 seconds. The Regera has a power-to-weight ratio of 0.7 kW (0.94 hp) per kilogram, and the
                    combined ICE and electric motors produce the highest combined peak power and torque output of any
                    other production hybrid car.</p>

        <div class="row featurette my-5">
            <div class="col-md-7">
                <p class="lead">The Venom GT is powered by a twin-turbocharged 427 cu in (7.0 L) GM LS7 V8 engine. The
                    LS9 architecture incorporates specific design features such as reinforced internal components and
                    additional head bolts with aluminum heads including twin Precision dual ball bearing turbochargers.
                    The engine has a power output of 1,244 hp (928 kW; 1,261 PS) at 6,600 rpm and 1,155 lb⋅ft (1,566
                    N⋅m) of torque at 4,400 rpm. Engine power output is adjustable by three settings: 800 hp (597 kW;
                    811 PS), 1,000 hp (746 kW; 1,014 PS) and 1,200 hp (895 kW; 1,217 PS). The engine has a redline of
                    7,200 rpm.On February 14, 2014, on the Kennedy Space Center's 3.22-mile (5.2 km) shuttle landing
                    strip in Florida, the Hennessey team recorded a top speed of 270.49 mph (435.31 km/h) in a limited
                    distance of 2.3 miles (3.7 km) with the Director of Miller Motorsport Park, Brian Smith driving the
                    car. As the run was in a single direction, and only 29 cars were produced (to qualify for Guinness
                    World Records a minimum of 30 cars are required to be produced), it does not qualify as the world's
                    fastest production car in the Guinness Book of Records.</p>

                <p class="lead">The Sesto Elemento is equipped with Lamborghini's 6-speed "e-gear" automated manual
                    transmission and an all-wheel-drive system, mated to a 5.2 litre V10 engine borrowed from the
                    Gallardo Superleggera, generating 570 PS (419 kW; 562 hp) and 540 N⋅m (398 lbf⋅ft) of torque. The
                    chassis, body, drive shaft and suspension components are made of carbon fibre, reducing the overall
                    weight to 999 kg (2,202 lb), a weight comparable to subcompact cars. The Sesto Elemento was the
                    first car to use forged carbon fibre (in the tub and suspension arms), a new type of carbon
                    composite developed by Lamborghini and Callaway Golf Company. The engine is cooled through 10
                    distinctive hexagonal holes in the engine cover, while two intakes funnel cool air into the
                    mid-mounted engine compartment and the exhaust pipes are positioned in the rear wing. Lamborghini
                    claims a 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) acceleration time of 2.5 seconds, 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) time of 8.0
                    seconds, and a top speed in excess of 356 km/h (221 mph).But Unfortunately only 20 Elemento exist.
